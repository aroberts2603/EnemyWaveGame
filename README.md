Enemy Wave Game

A game with waves of enemies that you have to defeat.
It started as a school project but now I do if for fun.
It's made in the python version of processing which was what we were learning at the time.
You can download processing here: https://processing.org/download/

Controls:

You can hold tab to show the scoreboard.
You can shoot with left click, you can switch weapon with 1, 2, and 3 but only after you buy them. Have fun!
